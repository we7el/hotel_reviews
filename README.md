# Sentiment Analysis on hotel reviews
This repository includes an experimentation with Natural Language Processing for sentiment analysis on hotel reviews.  
The dataset (from Booking.com) includes the name of the hotel, a unique user ID, room type, the rating, and the text review.  
Two methods were implemented for the task:
  - The first is a logistic regression with different sets of featurization for the different classes as well as for the text review.
  - The second is an LSTM model using Fasttext word embeddings.

Best accuracy achieved was 90.2%
